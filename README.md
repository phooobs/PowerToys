Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

For a video overview of PowerToys, including install steps and a walkthrough of the available utilities, check out the [PowerToys: Utilities to customize Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-d7KiwpnMA) episode of Tabs vs Spaces on YouTube.

## Current PowerToy Utilities

### Color Picker

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysColorPickerImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_ColorPicker) [Color Picker](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_ColorPicker) is a simple and quick system-wide color picker with <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. Color Picker allows to pick colors from any currently running application and automatically copies the HEX or RGB values to your clipboard. This code is based on [Martin Chrzan's Color Picker](https://github.com/martinchrzan/ColorPicker).

### FancyZones

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysFancyZoneImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_FancyZones) [FancyZones](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_FancyZones) is a window manager that makes it easy to create complex window layouts and quickly position windows into those layouts.

<br/>

### File Explorer Add-ons

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysPowerPreviewImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_FileExplorerAddOns) [File Explorer](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_FileExplorerAddOns) add-ons will enable SVG icon rendering and Preview Pane additions for File Explorer. 

Preview Pane is an existing feature in the File Explorer.  To enable it, you just click the View tab in the ribbon and then click "Preview Pane". PowerToys will now enable two types of files to be previewed: Markdown (.md) & SVG (.svg)
<br/>
<br/>

### Image Resizer

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysImageResizerImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_ImageResizer) [Image Resizer](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_ImageResizer) is a Windows Shell Extension for quickly resizing images.  With a simple right click from File Explorer, resize one or many images instantly. This code is based on [Brice Lambson's Image Resizer](https://github.com/bricelam/ImageResizer).

<br/>

### Keyboard Manager

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysKBMImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_KeyboardManager) [Keyboard Manager](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_KeyboardManager) allows you to customize the keyboard to be more productive by remapping keys and creating your own keyboard shortcuts.

### PowerRename

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysPowerRenameImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_PowerRename) [PowerRename](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_PowerRename) is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to. PowerRename then calls into the Windows Explorer file operations engine to perform the rename. This has the benefit of allowing the rename operation to be undone after PowerRename exits. This code is based on [Chris Davis's SmartRename](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename).

- Have [.NET Core 3.1 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.4-windows-x64-installer). The installer should handle this but we want to directly make people aware.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

Install from the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link]. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup-0.25.0-x64.exe` to download the PowerToys installer.

This is our preferred method.

```powershell
WinGet install powertoys
```

### Experimental PowerToys utility with Video conference muting

**Note:** We'll have 0.26 Experimental out in the first week of November 2020.

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficalInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

### Known issues
